<p style=" color: black; font-size: 20px; font-family:Arial">
<p> Hello everyone. I'm John Adrian C. Lagura. You can call me Jadi (if you want). And today, I'm going to talk about myself. I like to try new things, and I want to learn how to code because coding is an exciting hobby and a good fit for me as a teen who has had a love for tech in the past.I like to listen to old music. The bands and musicians I listened to so far are Metallica, ACDC, Nirvana, RHCP, Black Sabbath, and more. I barely listen to pop because pop is too repetitive. I even listen to classical composers like Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and many more. Not only that, but I listened to Blues because Chuck Berry and Jimi Hendrix introduced me to the world of blues rock. I listened to jazz music because it is more relaxing and groovy than lofi pop music. And my love for music expands because the content creators I watch have unique tastes in music, especially music content creators.I also like to play video games, especially retro games, and also do streaming on twitch (but I can’t expand my brand very well because I'm bad at marketing).
</p>
I think that's all for me to say. If you want to know more about me, you could follow my socials if you want(pls don't).
